REST is a software architectural style that defines the set of rules to be used for creating web services. Web services which follow the REST architectural style are known as RESTful web services. It allows requesting systems to access and manipulate web resources by using a uniform and predefined set of rules. Interaction in REST based systems happen through Internetâ€™s Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). \n",

    "\n",
    "SOAP was developed as an intermediate language for applications that have different programming languages, enabling these applications to communicate with each other over the internet. SOAP is flexible and independent, which enables developers to write SOAP application programming interfaces (APIs) in different languages while also adding features and functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "SOAP is a lightweight protocol used to create web APIs, usually with Extensible Markup Language (XML). It supports a wide range of communication protocols across the internet, HTTP, Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) and Transmission Control Protocol. The SOAP approach defines how a SOAP message is processed, the features and modules included, the communication protocols supported and the construction of SOAP messages. SOAP uses the XML Information Set as a message format and relies on application layer protocols, like HTTP, for message transmission and negotiation.\n",

    "1.The SOAP Envelope encapsulates all the data in a message and identifies the XML document as a SOAP message.\n",

    "2.SOAP is a protocol. SOAP was designed with a specification. It includes a WSDL file which has the required information on what the web service does in addition to the location of the web service.\n",
    "3.SOAP cannot make use of REST since SOAP is a protocol and REST is an architectural pattern.\n",
    "4.SOAP uses service interfaces to expose its functionality to client applications. In SOAP, the WSDL file provides the client with the necessary information which can be used to understand what services the web service can offer.\n",
    "5.SOAP requires more bandwidth for its usage. Since SOAP Messages contain a lot of information inside of it, the amount of data transfer using SOAP is generally a lot.\n",
    "6.SOAP can only work with XML format. As seen from SOAP messages, all data passed is in XML format.\n",

    "5.REST does not need much bandwidth when requests are sent to the server. REST messages mostly just consist of JSON messages. Below is an example of a JSON message passed to a web server. You can see that the size of the message is comparatively smaller to SOAP.\n",
